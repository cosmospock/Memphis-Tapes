# Music-Player with JavaScript

<h1> Welcome to Memphis! </h1>

<p>
This is a project I created to learn HTML / CSS / Javascript where I integrated my enjoyment for rare, lost Memphis mixtapes and mashed them into a media player. 
Enjoy some classics such as Tommy Wright III, Project Pat, Crunchy Black, DJ Paul and others.
